# Use the Web UI

English | [中文](index.zh.md)

## Start from npm

From the directory the agent may edit, run the reviewed downstream package directly from npm:

```sh
npx --yes @truly-private/omdsh@0.0.1 web
```

The command prints the Web UI URL; the default is `http://127.0.0.1:3080`. The `dsh` process uses its invoking directory as the default filesystem location, but a fresh Web UI has no selected workspace until you add one. The [root quick start](../../../README.md#run) covers 9Router setup, headless tasks, and auditable multi-agent orchestration with the same npm package.

## Configure a model

Open **Settings → Models**, enter a [DeepSeek API key](https://platform.deepseek.com/), and save it. The model route becomes usable immediately without restarting the server.

The [model configuration guide](./providers.md) covers other providers and custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints.

## Choose a workspace

Click **Choose workspace**, add the project directory where you started `dsh`, and select it. The session composer remains unavailable until a workspace is selected.

## Run a task

Start a session and send:

> Summarize this repository and identify its main packages.

The agent can read and edit workspace files, run commands, delegate work, and maintain a plan. The Web UI asks before operations that require approval under the active permission policy.
